Validation:
The reported PPE issue is relevant to the investigation.

REASONING AND FINDINGS

Finding:
The reported incident indicates a potential PPE compliance

Applicable area:
Workplace PPE and machinery safety requirements.

Severity:
Moderate potential safety risk.

Reason:
Failure to use required PPE near machinery can increase the
risk of workplace injury.

Recommended action:
Verify the applicable policy, confirm the incident evidence,
and reinforce PPE compliance before taking disciplinary action.

INVESTIGATION REPORT

1. Investigation Summary
A worker was reportedly observed near machinery without
proper personal protective equipment.

2. Evidence Reviewed
- Investigation request
- Retrieved workplace safety information
- Visual evidence, if provided

3. Relevant Policy / Rules
PPE requirements and machinery safety procedures should be
checked against the organization's applicable safety policy.

4. Findings
The incident represents a potential PPE compliance violation.

5. Severity
Moderate potential safety risk.

6. Recommended Corrective Actions
- Verify the incident and applicable policy.
- Ensure required PPE is available and used.
- Provide safety guidance or refresher training.
- Document the final investigation decision.

7. Limitations
The demonstration does not have a configured Gemini API,
actual employee statements, or verified incident imagery.
Therefore, the findings require human review.
